# opencourier-backend

## Overview

The API server: NestJS 9, Prisma 5 on PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Redis, MinIO, BullMQ, Socket.IO,
REST and GraphQL. Every other component talks to it.

**Read the workspace rulebook first: [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).** This repo sits inside the co-op workspace, and that file binds it: co-op values, locked decisions, domain language, boundaries, and the `aiflow.sh` pipeline every change goes through. Tools that stop at this repo's git root will not find it on their own. This file only adds what is specific to this component.

## Key files

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `src/domains/` | Domain services; `delivery/delivery.domain.service.ts` shows how events are emitted |
| `src/services/delivery-event/delivery-event.service.ts` | `processDeliveryEvent`: persists events, applies the state machine |
| `src/shared-types/stateMachine.ts` | `STATE_MACHINE`, the legal delivery status transitions |
| `src/rest-api/` | Controllers for the six API namespaces |
| `prisma/schema.prisma` | Schema; changes need operator approval and a new migration |
| `src/db-seeds/`, `scripts/` | Seeds and dev logins; Volos instance setup |

## Commands

Listed in the workspace rulebook under `opencourier-backend`. Yarn 4 via Corepack, Node 20.

## Gotchas

- Jest only runs `*.active.spec.ts`; a plain `*.spec.ts` is silently skipped.
- An event with no legal transition from the current status is dropped with only a log warning.

_Drafted by /audit from the repo, worth a quick human pass. Edit freely: once a line stops matching this draft, later runs treat it as curated and will flag rather than overwrite it._
